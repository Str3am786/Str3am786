**Data Science · Data/ML Systems · Knowledge Graphs · Information Extraction · RAG**

I build and evaluate ML models end-to-end—data → modeling → deployment. 

Grounded in rigorous data science.

Focus areas:
- Applied ML / Data Science: data cleaning, EDA, statistical modeling, evaluation
- LLMs + Graphs: RAG/GraphRAG, knowledge graphs, information extraction
- RL: reinforcement learning experiments + pipelines

Currently exploring: deep learning & generative models

## 🚀 Featured Projects

### 🧠 GraphRAG on KuzuDB (Text2Cypher + self-refining loop)
GraphRAG pipeline with caching and schema-aware query generation + automatic error fixing, backed by an evaluation harness.  
**Impact:** up to ~10× faster responses + improved answer quality (project evaluation).  
**Stack:** Python · DSPy · Docker · KuzuDB · Ollama/OpenRouter  
→ https://github.com/Str3am786/Scalable_Sys_Project_2

### ⚡ Complex Event Processing over Redis Streams
Containerized CEP pipeline to detect “hot paths” in Citi Bike trips (producer → sharded workers → writer + monitoring).  
**Impact:** efficient pattern detection over 17k+ trip records.  
**Stack:** Python · Redis Streams · Docker  
→ https://github.com/Str3am786/Scalable_Sys-Course-Project-1

### 📈 ML Regression Project (KTH DD2421)
Cleaned/merged 50k+ listings, outlier handling, and model training/evaluation.  
**Impact:** R² = 0.84 (top 10 in class).  
**Stack:** Python · scikit-learn · Matplotlib  
→ https://github.com/Str3am786/KTH-ML

### 📊 Bayesian Hierarchical Analysis: Education vs Poverty (US Counties)
Hierarchical vs pooled models across 3,139 counties + robustness checks with skeptical priors.  
**Stack:** R · brms/Stan  
→ https://github.com/Str3am786/bda

### 🕸️ KarmaNet: Sentiment-Weighted Reddit Political Networks
Built sentiment-weighted interaction graphs and evaluated link prediction vs baseline constructions.  
**Stack:** Python · network analysis
